Research Summary: Eniac's Discount Strategy Analysis

Introduction:
In this research project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of Eniac's discount strategy to determine its effectiveness and impact on sales. Through a series of data cleaning and exploration steps, we aimed to gain valuable insights into how discounts influence customer behavior and revenue generation.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis, we meticulously reorganized and selected the data. We focused on retaining only the orders that were both paid and shipped, eliminating any discrepancies or invalid information.

Understanding Discount Patterns:
By examining the Discount_% column, we discovered that a significant portion, 92% to be exact, of Eniac's products were sold with discounts. The average discount was found to be 21%, indicating that discounts played a substantial role in the company's pricing strategy.

Top 25% Quantity Analysis:
Our research further delved into the top 25% most sold products in terms of quantity. Among this group, all the products were exclusively purchased with discounted prices. Notably, 12 of these products were sold with an aggressive discount, equal to or above 40% of the normal price, with an average aggressive discount of approximately 24%. This finding revealed a strong preference for discounted products over regular-priced items.

Top 25% Revenue Analysis:
Similarly, we focused on the top 25% of revenue-generating products. All of these products were sold with discounts, but none of them had an aggressive discount. The average discount for this group was 9%, suggesting that discounted products significantly contributed to overall revenue, even without aggressive discounts.

Conclusion:
Our research indicates that Eniac's discount strategy plays a vital role in driving sales and revenue. Discounts are highly preferred by customers, and even moderate discounts have a notable impact on purchase behavior. Going forward, the findings from this study can guide Eniac in refining their discount strategy for optimal performance.
